# **oama** - OAuth credential MAnager

> [NOTE!]
> `oama` is the successor of `mailctl`; for rationale and details, see
> the [discussion](https://github.com/pdobsan/oama/discussions/26)

The Oauth2 credentials are kept in the
[**Gnome keyring**](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring/) or
in [GNU PG](https://www.gnupg.org/) **encrypted files**.

Many IMAP/SMTP clients, like [msmtp](https://marlam.de/msmtp/),
[fdm](https://github.com/nicm/fdm),
[isync](http://isync.sourceforge.net/),
[neomutt](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt) or
[mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) can use OAuth2 access tokens but lack the
ability to renew and/or authorize OAuth2 credentials. The purpose of
`oama` is to provide these missing capabilities by acting as a kind of
smart password manager. In particular, access token renewal happens
automatically in the background transparent to the user.

## Usage

Before `oama` is fully operational you need to create the necessary
configuration files. See details in [Configuration](#configuration).

Invoking `oama` without any arguments print a help message listing the
available commands:

    oama - OAuth credential MAnager with store/lookup, renewal, authorization.

    Usage: oama [--version] [-c|--config <config>] [--debug] COMMAND

      Oama is an OAuth credential manager providing store/lookup, automatic renewal
      and authorization operations. The credentials are stored either in the Gnome
      keyring or in files encrypted by GnuPG. Oama is useful for IMAP/SMTP or other
      network clients which cannot authorize and renew OAuth tokens on their own.

    Available options:
      -h,--help                Show this help text
      --version                Show version
      -c,--config <config>     Configuration file
                               (default: "~/.config/oama/config.yaml")
      --debug                  Print HTTP traffic to stdout

    Available commands:
      access                   Get the access token for email
      show                     Show current credentials for email
      renew                    Renew the access token of email
      authorize                Authorize OAuth2 for service/email
      printenv                 Print the current runtime environment
      template                 Print the default config template

More detailed help for individual commands can also be generated by appending
`-h` after the command. Shell completion for `bash`, `zsh` and `fish` shells
are provided.

After configuration, you must run the `authorize` command. That is an
interactive process involving a browser since during it, you need to login
and authorize access to your email account. `oama` will lead you through this
process.

## Configuration

`oama` has a simple configuration system.  The minimum information you need to
provide are `client_id` and `client_secret` and select the method of storing the
oauth credentials.

When you run `oama` at the first time it will create the initial config file
what you need to edit. This YAML file is commented explaining your options, just
follow the instructions there.

### Authorization for Corporate/Organizational/Institutional accounts

Corporation/Organization/Institution accounts might be treated differently
by the service provider. In such cases, not passing a login hint might be
useful, see below.

#### Google Organizational Account

Invoke `oama` with no login hint:

    oama authorize google <you@company.email> --nohint

#### Microsoft Organizational Account

Invoke `oama` using your proper organizational email:

    oama authorize microsoft <you@company.email>

Then visit the `http://localhost:8080/start` page to perform the steps
below:

 - Click "Sign in with another account"
 - Click "Sign-in options"
 - Click "Sign in to an organization"
 - Put in the correct domain name which matches your organization address above
 - Log in with your credentials at the organization.

## Logging

All transactions and exceptions are logged to `syslog`. If your OS using
`systemd` you can inspect the log with a command like below:

    journalctl --identifier oama --identifier msmtp --identifier fdm -e

## Installation

### Compiled static binaries

Each release contains compiled executables of `oama` which should work on
most Linux distributions. Currently Linux/x86_64 and Linux/aarch64(arm64)
binaries are provided. Select the version you want to download from
[releases](https://github.com/pdobsan/oama/releases).

#### Archlinux

For Archlinux users there is also a package on AUR:
[oama-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/oama-bin)

### Building from sources

To build `oama` from source you need a Haskell development environment,
with `ghc 9.4.8` or higher. Either your platform's package system can provide
this or you can use [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/). Once you have
the `ghc` Haskell compiler and `cabal` etc. installed, follow the steps
below:

Clone this repository and invoke `cabal`:

    git clone https://github.com/pdobsan/oama
    cd oama
    cabal update
    cabal install --install-method=copy

That installs `oama` into the `~/.cabal/bin/` directory.
